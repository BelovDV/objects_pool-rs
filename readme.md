# Objects pool

Store objects in pool and manipulate their ids.

Is there common implementation of this (on [crates.io](crates.io))?

## Purpose

It was written for two use cases:

- switch from `String` identficators to `Id` - just integer,
- simple work with DAGs.

## Example

[//]: # (Example will be written after `PoolUnique` creation)
```rust
```
